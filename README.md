# Fullstack-E-Comm-Site
Just me learning full-stack by iteratively developing this site.

## API's and Technology
Use FakeStore API for product data, HTML, CSS, Javascript for Frontend, Backend and Database: TBA, Payment Processing: Stripe?

## Features
Sign up/Log in, Search for products, product pages with reviews and related products (long term goal, some form of ranking algo?), Payment processing, user authentication.

## LATEST TO DO
Link pages together, add user authentication and build out the backend to send and receive user records,
i.e. whether they logged in or not, from the database. 


## LONG TERM GOAL
The goal with this project is not to display some UI/UX godly talent. It's more to do with writing up a backend, integrating 
and interacting with a database, and trying to stick to best practices while doing so such that the application is always in a scalable state.
